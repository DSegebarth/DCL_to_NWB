# DCL_to_NWB

## The Aim: an interactive widget to convert data of the DCL into the NWB:N standard
---
This repository is part of the **DCLwidgets** series. 
These repositories are dedicated to foster the joint development of tools and resources by the [Defense Circuits Lab](https://www.defense-circuits-lab.com/). 
The intended use of each tool may vary greatly from very lab- and/or analysis-specific problems, to tools and resources that may be of use also for other researchers.
The common goal for each repository, however, is to provide the tool as an interactive, userfriendly, and intuitive GUI so that the user needs little to no coding expertise.

List of all repositories of the DCLwidgets series:
- [DCL_stats_and_plots](https://github.com/DSegebarth/DCL_stats_and_plots/): A widget to compute statistics and plot the data with several options to customize the plot
- [DCL_to_NWB](https://github.com/DSegebarth/DCL_to_NWB/): A widget to convert datasets acquired in the DCL into the NWB file format
- [BSc_MS](https://github.com/DSegebarth/BSc_MS/): A widget to annotate the corners of a maze within video files and save the corresponding x- and y-coordinates

## About this widget

The goal of this repository is an interactive widget that converts datasets acquired in the DCL into the NWB:N data standard, running in a virtual research environment. However, instead of requiring the user to enter all relevant metadata, which creates additional workload and presents another potential error source, the widget is supposed to grab all metadata information right from the corresponding electronical lab-notebook (ELN) entries.
Thus, the widget will only require the user to select the directory that contains the raw data that shall be converted, and provide the corresponding ELN entry.
Once setup, the projects page of this repository will give you an overview of how the project is going and what is currently planned as next steps.

If you like the idea, are working on a similar project, or have any other question or feedback - we are happy to get in touch!
